# MasterFudge
"What am I even doing", indeed. Not much to see here, just a little bit, very much not yet finished. Not sure if "yet", "ever", "whatever", "dishwasher", eh.

## Status
* __Z80__: All documented opcodes done (main, CB-, DD-, ED- and FD-prefix; only a few "undocumented" ones), possibly still with issues (flags, etc.)
* __VDP__: Basic background and sprite rendering, somewhat iffy scrolling; bad timing and missing features
* __Memory__: Working, I guess; nothing fancy here
* __Cartridges__: Basic Sega mapper support (ROM and RAM), maybe not quite as buggy as some other parts
* __Input__: P1 joypad should work, I think
* __Sound__: No sir, neither PSG nor FM!
* __Misc__: Region selection; overall timing isn't very good

Otherwise, if it's not listed above, it's probably not there yet at all.

* Sonic the Hedgehog: Seems alright, but scrolling feels a bit choppy.<br>

* Ys - The Vanished Omens: Missing its status bar, need to look into that, otherwise okay?<br>

* Castle of Illusion: Seems pretty alright, not unlike Sonic.<br>
