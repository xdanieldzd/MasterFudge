# MasterFudge
MasterFudge is an incomplete Sega Master System and Game Gear emulator written in C#. It is not very accurate, is missing features (see below for details) and is generally somewhat fudged together, hence its name.

## Status
* __Z80__: All documented opcodes done (main, CB-, DD-, ED- and FD-prefix; only a few "undocumented" ones), possibly still with issues (flags, etc.)
* __VDP__: Mostly done, but with inaccurate timing and missing the "legacy" display modes
* __Memory__: Working, I guess; nothing fancy here
* __Cartridges__: Basic Sega mapper support (ROM and RAM), does not save cartridge RAM yet
* __Input__: P1 joypad/Game Gear buttons, SMS Pause and Reset are implemented and work
* __Sound__: Some really crappy PSG emulation and missing the noise channel
* __Misc__: Region selection; overall timing isn't very good

Otherwise, if it's not listed above, it's probably not there yet at all.
