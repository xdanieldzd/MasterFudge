# MasterFudge
"What am I even doing", indeed. Not much to see here, just a little bit, very much not yet finished. Not sure if "yet", "ever", "whatever", "dishwasher", eh.

## Status
* __Z80__: All opcodes done (main, CB-, DD-, ED- and FD-prefix) but with issues (flags, etc)
* __VDP__: Basic background and sprite rendering, some bad scrolling; much is missing
* __Memory__: Working, I guess; nothing fancy here
* __Cartridges__: Basic Sega mapper support (ROM and RAM), probably buggy
* __Input__: P1 joypad should work, I think
* __Sound__: No sir, neither PSG nor FM!
* __Misc__: If it's not listed above, it's probably not there (yet)

* Sonic the Hedgehog: Sonic can barely walk, controls and engine issues galore!<br>

* Ys - The Vanished Omens: You can kinda walk around and admire the visual and physical glitches, I guess?<br>

* Castle of Illusion: Not unlike with Sonic, you'll soon encounter floating enemies and other strangeness.<br>
