"What am I even doing", indeed. Nothing to see here, not sure if "yet", "ever", "whatever", "dishwasher", eh.

## Status
* __Z80__: All opcodes done (main, CB-, DD-, ED- and FD-prefix), likely with issues (flags, etc)
* __VDP__: Very basic background rendering; much is missing, what's there is kinda broken
* __Memory__: Working, I guess; nothing fancy here
* __Cartridges__: Basic Sega mapper support (ROM and RAM), probably buggy
* __Input__: Not yet! 
* __Sound__: No sir, neither PSG nor FM!
* __Misc__: If it's not listed above, it's probably not there (yet)
