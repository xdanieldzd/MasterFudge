# MasterFudge
MasterFudge is an incomplete Sega Master System and Game Gear emulator written in C#. It is not very accurate, is missing features (see below for details) and is generally somewhat fudged together, hence its name.

## Status
* __Z80__: All documented opcodes done (main, CB-, DD-, ED- and FD-prefix; only a few "undocumented" ones), possibly still with issues (flags, etc.)
* __VDP__: Mostly done, but with inaccurate timing and missing the "legacy" display modes
* __Memory__: Working, I guess; nothing fancy here
* __Cartridges__: Basic Sega mapper support (ROM and RAM), does not save cartridge RAM yet
* __Input__: P1 joypad/Game Gear buttons, SMS Pause and Reset are implemented and work
* __Sound__: Some really crappy PSG emulation and missing the noise channel
* __Misc__: Region selection; overall timing isn't very good

Otherwise, if it's not listed above, it's probably not there yet at all.

## Known Issues
Known issues as of [this commit](https://github.com/xdanieldzd/MasterFudge/tree/53e02aa9e45cdd688efaa5a790f260b064c27d6f); there's most likely more:

* __Master System__
 * __Chase H.Q.__: Doesn't react to buttons on title screen
 * __F-16 Fighting Falcon__: Uses non-SMS VDP mode; not implemented
 * __[VDP Test ROM](http://www.smspower.org/Homebrew/SMSVDPTest-SMS)__: Fails most HCounter tests, sprite off-screen Y collision test
* __Game Gear__
 * __Fantasy Zone Gear__: Crash during startup; memory mapping issues?
 * __GG Shinobi__: Crash during intro; memory mapping issues?
 * __Gunstar Heroes__: Crash during startup; memory mapping issues?
